UCP - THE BEST FILE TRANSFER PROGRAM EVER!!!

I hate huge repositories so rather than put everything in this one, you'll
have to have a couple dependencies installed on your system and in the 
build path.  You can thank me later.

Dependencies
------------------
Boost 1.42


cmake 2.8.3 (For generating makefile)

Building
----------------

Run build.sh in the root of the project.
