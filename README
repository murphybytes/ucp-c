UCP - THE BEST FILE TRANSFER PROGRAM EVER!!!

I hate huge repositories so rather than put everything in this one, you'll
have to have a couple dependencies installed on your system and in the 
build path.  You can thank me later.

Dependencies
------------------
Boost 1.42


cmake 2.8.3 (For generating makefile)

Building
----------------

Run build.sh in the root of the project.  

You may have to specify your architecture and operating system
to build:

UDT_OS=[LINUX(default), BSD, OSX]
UDT_ARCH=[IA64(default), IA32, POWERPC, IA64, AMD64]
