UCP - THE BEST FILE TRANSFER PROGRAM EVER!!!

I hate huge repositories so rather than put everything in this one, you'll
have to have a couple dependencies installed on your system and in the 
build path.  You can thank me later.

External Dependencies
------------------
Boost 1.46

I've listed the libraries that are required on the system to build and
run UCP.  Most of these will already be on your system, but if they are not
you'll have to install them along with development headers. 

libboost_program_options
libboost_regex
libboost_signals
libboost_thread
libboost_filesystem
libstdc++
libm
libgcc_s
libc
libpthread
libboost_system
librt
libicudata
libicui18n
libicuuc
libcrypto++ 

cmake 2.8.3 (For generating makefile)

Building
----------------

Install cmake and run build.sh in the root of the project.  

UDT_OS and UDT_ARCH environment variables may be defined to specify architecture and operating system 
before building. 

UDT_OS=[LINUX(default), BSD, OSX]
UDT_ARCH=[IA64(default), IA32, POWERPC, IA64, AMD64]

Testing
-------------------------------
The build script will create unit tests in a binary called 'test'.  Run test_setup.sh
before running the test script. This script will create a test user 
that is used for some of the unit tests. 

Usage
-------------------------------
ucp options:
  -h [ --help ]                    Show help message.
  -v [ --version ]                 Show version.
  -V [ --verbose ]                 Verbose output.
  -l [ --log-level ] arg (=3)      Log level, 3 most verbose, 0 least verbose
  -L [ --listener ]                Run in listener mode.
  -P [ --listen-port ] arg (=9090) Port to listen on in listener mode
  -p [ --pid-directory ] arg (=/var/run) Directory to store pid file if in daemon mode
  -m [ --max-bandwidth ] arg (= -1) Throttle bandwidth value in bytes per second.  -1 = infinite
  -d [ --daemonize ]               Run in daemon mode (Listener only)
  --copy-command arg               Client copy command source-file 
                                   user@host:port:dest-file

The ucp program can run as client or server.  The typical use case would be to have 
a server running on a machine as a deamon and kick of ucp in client mode on 
another machine to transfer files back and forth.  You'll want to  run ucp in server 
mode as root like so:

sudo ./ucp -L -d --pid-directory=$(pwd) >> ucp.log & 

You could then tail the ucp.log to see what's going on with the file transfers.

Call the client to send a file to the server

./ucp filetotransfer me@myhost:/home/me/serverfile

Call the client to send a file to the client

./ucp me@myhost:/home/me/serverfile clientfile

As you can see, ucp works pretty much like scp.  

Note.  ucp now uses ssh to authenticate users.  If you are a client wishing to send files to user
'foo' on a server you'll need to do the following:

1) create a public rsa key 
   ssh-keygen -t rsa 
2) transfer public key to user foo on server
   scp .ssh/id_rsa.pub foo@server.com:
3) append your key to authorized users file
   ssh foo@server.com 'cat id_rsa.pub >> .ssh/authorized_keys'
4) create a hidden directory for ucp keys
   ssh foo@server.com 'mkdir ~/.ucp'


TODO's 

create command line way to specify location of log file.
